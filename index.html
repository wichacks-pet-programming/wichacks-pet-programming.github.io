	<p>Learn about the Java programming language by interacting with virtual
	pet "objects."</p>
	<p>Java is an Object Oriented language.  This means that it uses the concept of objects to
	represent data.</p>
	<p>In the example presented here, you will encounter an abstract class
	Animal which is extened by 3 different classes, Cat, Dog, and Dinosaur.<br />
	Animal has two varieties of methods:  some are labelled as abstract, and
	some are not.<br />  The abstract methods are placeholders of sorts:  any class
	that extends Animal must implement these or else be an abstract class as well.<br />
	The other methods in Animal, however, have code associated with them; an extending
	class may override these methods, but is not required to do so.</p>
