	<h1>Welcome to Pet Programming!</h1>
	<p>Learn about the Java programming language by interacting with virtual
	pet "objects."</p>
	<p>Java is an Object Oriented language.  It uses the concept of objects to
	represent data.</p>
	<p>In the example presented here, you will be presented with an Interface
	Animal which is implemented by 3 different classes, Cat, Dog, and Dinosaur.
	The Interface Animal provides a list of methods that any implementing classes
	must provide code for:  speak, jump, and wave.  Because Cat, Dog, and Dinosaur
	implement Animal, each can be referred to as "Animal" and will choose their 
	own versions of the method.</p>
